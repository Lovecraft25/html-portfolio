<H1>The Best Movies According to Mark</H1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Godfather</h3>
<p>The Godfather is often hailed as one of the greatest films ever made. Its narrative depth, complex characters, and masterful direction set a benchmark for cinematic storytelling. The film's portrayal of the Corleone family, led by the iconic Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando, showcases exceptional performances. The film's strength lies in its intricate exploration of themes such as power, loyalty, and corruption.</p>
<h3>The Godfather 2</h3>
<p>One of the best sequels ever made. Arguably better than the first movie.</p>
<h3>Jaws</h3>
<p>One of the scariest movies ever made. Seen it when I was 11 and still have trouble going in the ocean.</p>
